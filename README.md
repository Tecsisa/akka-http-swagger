# akka-http-swagger

Akka-Http-Swagger brings [Swagger](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core) support for [Akka](http://akka.io) Apis. The included ```SwaggerHttpService``` route will inspect Scala types with Swagger annotations and build a swagger compliant endpoint for a [swagger compliant ui](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui).

The swagger spec [swagger spec](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md) is helpful for understanding the swagger api and resource declaration semantics behind swagger-core annotations.

## Getting Akka-Http-Swagger

### Release Version

The starting code used for this library has been extracted from ```Spray-swagger``` [sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org) and mirrored to Maven Central.
Akka-http-swagger is cross-compiled with scala 2.10.4 and 2.11.2.

```
libraryDependencies += "com.tecsisa" %% "akka-http-swagger" % "0.5.3-SNAPSHOT"
```

## Testing

The ```/test``` directory includes an ```HttpSwaggerServiceSpec``` which leverages ```akka-http-testkit-experimental``` to test the API. It uses a ```PetHttpService``` and ```UserHttpService``` declared in the ```/samples``` folder.

## SwaggerHttpService

The ```SwaggerHttpService``` is a trait extending Spray's ```HttpService```. It will generate the appropriate Swagger json schema based on a set of inputs declaring your Api and the types you want to expose.

The  ```SwagerHttpService``` will contain a ```routes``` property you can concatenate along with your existing akka-http routes. This will expose an endpoint at ```<baseUrl>/<specPath>/<resourcePath>``` with the specified ```apiVersion```, ```swaggerVersion``` and resource listing.

The service requires a set of ```apiTypes``` and ```modelTypes``` you want to expose via Swagger. These types include the appropriate Swagger annotations for describing your api. The ```SwaggerHttpService``` will inspect these annotations and build the appropriate Swagger response.

Here's an example ```SwaggerHttpService``` snippet which exposes [Wordnik's PetStore](http://swagger.wordnik.com/) resources, ```Pet```, ```User``` and ```Store```. The routes property can be concatenated to your other route definitions:


```
  def actorRefFactory = context
  def apiTypes = Seq(typeOf[service1], typeOf[service2])
  def apiVersion = "1.0"

  override def baseUrl = "/"
  override def docsPath = "docs"

  val route = swaggerRoutes ~ get {
      pathPrefix("swagger") {
        pathEndOrSingleSlash {
          getFromResource("swagger-ui/index.html")
        }
      } ~ getFromResourceDirectory("swagger-ui")
    } ~ service1Route ~ service2Route
```

## Adding Swagger Annotations

Routing works by concatenating various routes, built up by directives, to produce an api. The [routing dsl](http://spray.io/documentation/1.2.2/spray-routing/) is an elegant way to describe an api and differs from the more common class and method approach of other frameworks. But because Swagger's annotation library requires classes, methods and fields to describe an Api, one may find it difficult to annotate a akka-http-routing application.

A simple solution is to break apart a akka-http-routing application into various resource traits, with methods for specific api operations, joined by route concatenation into a route property. These traits with can then be joined together by their own route properties into a complete api. Despite losing the completeness of an entire api the result is a more modular application with a succinct resource list.

The balance is up to the developer but for a reasonably-sized application organizing routes across various traits is probably a good idea.

With this structure you can apply ```@Api``` annotations to these individual traits and ```@ApiOperation``` annotations to methods.

You can also use jax-rs ```@Path``` annotations alongside ```@ApiOperation```s if you need fine-grained control over path specifications or if you want to support multiple paths per operation. The functionality is the same as swagger-core.

### Resource Definitions

The general pattern for resource definitions and Akka-Http routes:

* Place an individual resource in its own trait
* Annotate the trait with ```@Api``` to describe the resource
* Define specific api operations with ```def``` methods which produce a route
* Annotate these methods with ```@ApiOperation```, ```@ApiImplictParams``` and ```@ApiResponse``` accordingly
* Concatenate operations together into a single routes property, wrapped with a path directive for that resource
* Concatenate all resource traits together on their routes property to produce the final route structure for your application.

Here's what Swagger's *pet* resource would look like:

```
@Api(value = "/pet", description = "Operations about pets")
trait PetHttpService extends HttpService {

  @ApiOperation(httpMethod = "GET", response = classOf[Pet], value = "Returns a pet based on ID")
  @ApiImplicitParams(Array(
      new ApiImplicitParam(name = "petId", required = false, dataType = "integer", paramType = "path", value = "ID of pet that needs to be fetched")
        ))
  @ApiResponses(Array(
    new ApiResponse(code = 400, message = "Invalid ID Supplied"),
    new ApiResponse(code = 404, message = "Pet not found")))
  def petGetRoute = get { path("pet" / IntNumber) { petId =>
    complete(s"Hello, I'm pet ${petId}!")
    } }
}
```

Notice the use of ```ApiImplicitParams```. This is the best way to apply parameter information. The ```paramType``` can be used to specify ```path```, ```body```, ```header```, ```query``` or ```form```. If the dataType value is not of the basic types, ```akka-http-swagger``` will try and find the type in the ```modelTypes``` sequence. Refer to *swagger-core* for other attribute information.

### Model Definitions

Model definitions are fairly self-explanatory. Attributes are applied to case class entities and their respective properties. A simplified Pet model:

```
@ApiModel(description = "A pet object")
case class Pet(
  @(ApiModelProperty @field)(value = "unique identifier for the pet")
  val id: Int,

  @(ApiModelProperty @field)(value = "The name of the pet")
  val name: String)
```

## Swagger UI

This library does not include [Swagger's UI](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui) only the api support for powering a UI. Adding such a UI to your Akka-Http app is easy with ```getFromResource``` and ```getFromResourceDirectory``` support.

To add a Swagger UI to your site, simply drop the static site files into the resources directory of your project. The following trait will expose a ```swagger``` route hosting files from the ```resources/swagger/`` directory:

```
trait Site extends HttpService {
  val site =
    path("swagger") { getFromResource("swagger/index.html") } ~
      getFromResourceDirectory("swagger")
}
```

You can then mix this trait with a new or existing Akka-Http class with an ```actorRefFactory``` and concatenate the ```site``` route value to your existing route definitions.

## How Annotations are Mapped to Swagger

Let's categorize [the Swagger Spec](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md) into the following levels:

* [The Resource Listing](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md#51-resource-listing), at the root level of documentation, which provides an overview of multiple endpoints by listing available resources as an array of [Resource Objects](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md#512-resource-object) via the ```apis``` property, authorizations required for the API (via the ```authorizations``` property) and descriptive information about the API (via the ``info`` property)
* API Declarations, at a subsequent level, providing information about a specific API endpoint exposed with an [API Declaration](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md#52-api-declaration). As per the Swagger spec there should be one file per Resource described in the Api listing. An API delcaration, via its ```apis``` property, lists available operations on the resource with an array of [API Objects](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md#522-api-object) each having its own unique path. In turn each API Object has an array of [Operations](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md#523-operation-object) describing the available actions on that path.

* The Resource Listing is based on fields set when declaring the ```HttpService```.
* The Resource Listing ```apis``` property--the list of ```Resource Objects```--are built based on the ```apiTypes``` set when declaring the ```HttpService```.
* The ```@Api.value``` is used to specify the path in the ```Resource Objects``` list. This is relative and points to the ```API Declaration``` describing the resource.
* An individual API Declaration is built from a combination of ```@Api``` and ```@ApiOperation``` annotations set on a specific akka service object. Anything describing a property related to an API Declaration is set via the ```@Api``` annotation and anything related to an Operation is done via ```@ApiOperation```.
* Akka-Http-Swagger does not validate that annotation values conform to the spec; this is up to the developer when applying annotations. We are adding functionality to provide validation when possible.
* ```@Path``` will override the provided default value from ```@ApiOperation```. It is only applicable with ```@ApiOperation```.
* By default an API Declaration's ```basePath``` is set from the ```HttpService.baseUrl``` property (this should be a full url) but can be overriden by specifying a ```basePath``` in an ```@Api``` annotation (again, as per spec, should be a full url).
